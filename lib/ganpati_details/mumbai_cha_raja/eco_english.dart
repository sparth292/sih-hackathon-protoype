        "In recent years, the Mumbai Raja Ganpati Mandal has focused on creating eco-friendly idols. Traditional Ganpati idols were made using Plaster of Paris (POP) and chemical paints, which caused water pollution after immersion. This increased pollution in rivers, ponds, and the sea, negatively affecting aquatic life and the environment.",
    "solution":
        "As a solution, the Mandal started using nature-friendly materials. Now, idols are made using clay, natural colors, and other biodegradable materials. Such idols do not pollute water after immersion and reduce negative environmental impact. Using eco-friendly idols also allows devotees to experience traditional devotion while staying mindful of the Earth and nature.",
    "socialMessage":
        "Moreover, using eco-friendly idols sends a social message. It demonstrates that religious festivals and environmental care can go hand in hand. Therefore, the Mumbai Raja Ganpati Mandal is setting an example not only in devotion and social initiatives but also in environmental conservation."
