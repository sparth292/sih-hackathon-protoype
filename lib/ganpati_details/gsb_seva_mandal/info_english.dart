        "At the GSB Seva Mandal's Ganesh festival, the idol is decorated in an extremely grand manner. The idol is adorned with 66 kg of gold and 336 kg of silver ornaments, making it not just a center of religious devotion but also a symbol of beauty and grandeur. This decoration gives the idol a special attractive and majestic appearance that fascinates millions of devotees.",
    "insurance":
        "Due to the grandeur of the idol and the valuable ornaments it carries, security becomes extremely important. Therefore, in 2025, insurance coverage worth ₹474.46 crore was taken for the festival. This insurance is not only for the gold and silver ornaments but also includes volunteers, priests, and security personnel to provide protection against any unforeseen accidents or losses.",
    "overallImpact":
