    "description":
        "The Keshavji Naik Chawl Ganpati Mandal has had an eco-friendly Ganpati idol for the past 132 years, approximately two feet tall. This idol is made using natural and environmentally friendly materials instead of traditional Plaster of Paris. This ensures that after the festival, immersion of the idol does not pollute rivers and water sources, keeping aquatic life and the environment safe.",
    "communityImpact":
        "The small size of the idol encourages local community participation. Devotees get an opportunity to take part in decorating the idol, and children are inspired to create art using eco-friendly materials. The smaller size and lightweight nature of the idol also make transportation and immersion easier, making the festival more convenient and safer.",
    "culturalMessage":
        "The eco-friendliness of the idol is not only environmentally significant but also carries a cultural message. Devotees are taught that while upholding tradition and devotion, it is essential to protect the environment. In this way, the Keshavji Naik Chawl Ganpati Mandal serves not only as a religious celebration but also as an example of social and environmental responsibility."
